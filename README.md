# The Times Component Library

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/newsuk/times-components/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/newsuk/times-components)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/newsuk/times-components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/newsuk/times-components)

### Purpose

Home of The Times' `react native` pages, shared code between the iOS and Android app that doesn't belong to [Times Components](https://www.github.com/newsuk/times-components)

### Dev Environment

We require MacOS with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >=8 with npm v5),
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (latest) and
[watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) installed.
You can try without these requirements, but you'd be on your own.

## Getting Started

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
